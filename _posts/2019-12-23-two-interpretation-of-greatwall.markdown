平日習慣同時閱讀幾本書，即使題材毫不相干，偶爾還是能夠發現微妙的聯繫。

這次同時看的書，一本是[巫寧坤](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B7%AB%E5%AE%81%E5%9D%A4)的[「一滴淚」](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31907525)，另一本是 [Marina Abramović](http://www.artnet.com/artists/marina-abramovic/) 的 [*Walk Through Walls*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28814918-walk-through-walls)。

巫寧坤 1920 年生，專業是英美文學，1951 受到「新中國」邀請回國去燕京大學教書，不久就被批為「反革命」，經歷二十年政治運動的折磨，險些喪命。他被無理判為「右派分子」的時候，遊覽長城時寫到：

> 終於面對長城了，我實在看不出這座巨大可怕的灰磚建築物如何值得人們讚歎。我感到十分難過，當我緬懷歷朝歷代無數的好男兒拋妻別子，在鞭子和刀槍的驅趕下，來修築這個吞噬青春和生命的龐然怪物。怡楷和我離開人群，單獨登上長城。到了盯上，怡楷問我：「你喜歡這個世界第七奇蹟嗎？」我說：「這真是個『奇蹟』！這是那個焚書坑儒的『千古一帝』用無數奴隸的白骨修建的專制暴政紀念碑。其實又何止他一個！一代接一代的昏君效法他，實行暴政，奴役人民，又擴建這座壁壘，妄圖鞏固專制王朝。奧維爾真該把它放進《一九八四》的，在山海觀的門樓上寫下但丁寫在地獄門口的名言：『放棄一切希望吧，你們進入這裡的人們！』」

Marina 是 1946 年生人，被稱為「行為藝術之祖母」。她其中一個作品是 1988 年與情人烏雷從長城兩端出發，步行三個月之後在中間會合後分手，名為「The Lovers」。說到這個作品想法的源頭：

> At first, like almost everybody else, we’d thought that the Chinese had built the Great Wall to protect themselves from Genghis Khan and the Mongol tribes. But as we did more reading, we found that this wasn’t true. What we discovered was that the Wall had been designed in the form of a gigantic dragon, as a mirror image of the Milky Way. The ancient Chinese had started the Wall by sinking twenty-five ships at the edge of the Yellow Sea in order to create the foundation for the dragon’s head. Then, after the dragon rose from the sea, its body twisted across the landscape and through the mountains, corresponding exactly to the shape of the Milky Way, until it reached the Gobi Desert, where the tail was buried.

> Our plan was for me to start the walk at the Wall’s eastern, female end, the Gulf of Bohai on the Yellow Sea, and for Ulay to start at the Wall’s western, male end, the Jiayu Pass in the Gobi Desert. After walking a total of 2,500 kilometers each, we would meet in the middle.

兩種解讀截然不同，一種充滿政治批評，一種充滿東方神話的神秘。但兩種都讓我耳目一新。

阿布拉莫維奇與巫寧坤還很相似的一點是，對共產主義美學的討厭。

> I come from a dark place. Postwar Yugoslavia, the mid-1940s to the mid-’70s. A Communist dictatorship, Marshal Tito in charge. Perpetual shortages of everything, drabness everywhere. There is something about Communism and socialism—it’s a kind of aesthetic based on pure ugliness.

> I always remember the communal spaces – they would be painted this dirty green color, and there were these naked bulbs that gave off a gray light that kind of shadowed the eyes. The combination of the light and the color of the walls made everybody's skin yellowish-greenish, like they were liver-sick. Whatever you did, there would be a feeling of oppression, and a little bit of depression.

阿布拉莫維奇走長城時，需要在附近村莊下榻：
> Even the bigger inns were depressing—undecorated concrete blocks without indoor toilet facilities. The lighting was terrible; where the walls were painted, they were painted that hospital green I remembered all too well. It was like Belgrade squared.

巫寧坤回家：
> 可是故鄉變化不小，乍一看，幾乎面目全非。那熟悉的城牆不見了，那些青石板路也不見了，我的腳下是一條板着幹部面孔的水泥大街。兩旁排列着千篇一律的兩三層的水泥樓房，要多醜有多醜。
