I was interested in writing as a form of creation last year, so I read two books on writing: [Bird by Bird](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8117684-bird-by-bird) by Anne Lamott and [Writing Down the Bones](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44905.Writing_Down_the_Bones) by Natalie Goldberg.

In the end the issue was that I couldn't tell their voices apart. Both have some heartfelt advice on writing as well as a lot of repetitive points that I just churn through.

Still I want to share some quotes on creating art that I resonate with.


### Artwork belongs to that specific time of creation
I used to be very afraid of putting my work out there because I know whatever goes out (on the internet) is in a way permanent, while I know I change all the time. Sometimes I look at my old work or my old self but only want to disassociate me now from me then.

Natalie puts it as *We are not the poem*:
> The problem is that we think we exist. We think our words are permanent and solid and stamp us forever. That’s not true. We write in the moment. ... Watch yourself. Every minute we change. It is a great opportunity. At any point, we can step out of our frozen selves and our ideas and begin fresh. That is how writing is. Instead of freezing us, it frees us.

And again in the *Afterword*:
> Q: What would you say to Natalie when she was working on Writing Down the Bones?

> I couldn’t tell her anything. She was who she was. She wouldn’t hear me. ... She was so earnest. She worked so hard. And she was so innocent. And in some ways she was smarter, she hadn’t been broken as much, and I think we see certain kinds of things more clearly when we’re not as broken.

So accept that you will be different. I may get better at what I do later, look back and be embarrassed by what I create now, but that doesn't discount what I make as long as I put my heart into it.

### Why do you write?
And related to change, writing as a way of capturing a time that would otherwise be lost. Natalie in *Why Do I Write*:
> Why do I write? I write because I kept my mouth shut all my life and the secret ego truth is I want to live eternally and I want my people to live forever. I hurt at our impermanence, at the passing of time.

Anne talks about the intrinsic pleasure of creation:
> There are moments when I am writing when I think that if other people knew how I felt right now, they’d burn me at the stake for feeling so good, so full, so much intense pleasure.

Writing for others and the society:
> The society to which we belong seems to be dying or is already dead. I don’t mean to sound dramatic, but clearly the dark side is rising. Things could not have been more odd and frightening in the Middle Ages. But the tradition of artists will continue no matter what form the society takes. And this is another reason to write: people need us, to mirror for them and for each other without distortion—not to look around and say, “Look at yourselves, you idiots!,” but to say, “This is who we are.”


### The artist is alone

Artists needs to alone. Creating something is alone.

Natalie, in *Why Do I Write*:
> I write because I am alone and move through the world alone. No one will know what has passed through me, and even more amazing, I don’t know.

And in *Epilogue*:
> Anything we fully do is an alone journey. No matter how happy your friend may be for you, how much they support you, you can’t expect anyone to match the intensity of your emotions or to completely understand what you went through.
