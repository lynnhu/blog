# blog
I have been thinking about inputting and outputting, consuming and creating in my life.

I travel. I read. I get inspired by art. These are inputs into my life, my consumpsion of things others have created.
Then the question is what I give this world in return?

This blog is an attempt to answer that. And it's very much still under construction.
